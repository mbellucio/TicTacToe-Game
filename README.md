## About this project 📌

This is a simple terminal Tic Tac Toe game<br>
that you can play against an AI. No external<br>
libraries were used. 

## Python Modules Used 🐍

• Random<br>
• Time

## How AI plays 🕹

AI always play second, being the "O" in the game.<br>
For that reason, the AI main priority is to defend<br>
against the user possible winning sequence. In case<br>
there is no possible winning sequece from the user<br>
(meaning 2/3 of it) AI will search for an available<br>
winning sequence.
